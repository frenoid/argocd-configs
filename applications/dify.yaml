  # RevisionHistoryLimit limits the number of items kept in the application's revision history, which is used for
  # informational purposes as well as for rollbacks to previous versions. This should only be changed in exceptional
  # circumstances. Setting to zero will store no history. This will reduce storage used. Increasing will increase the
  # space used to store the history, so we do not recommend increasing it.
